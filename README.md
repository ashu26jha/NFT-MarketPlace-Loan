### NFT MarketPlace Structure
- Could list on marketplace (Only Owner)
- Change the list price (Only Owner)
- Remove from the marketplace (Only Owner)

### NFT 
- Could list the NFT for loan. With the loan amount needed. And the duration.
- Loan terms can be negotiated
- Loan terms üñä: Duration, Total amount. 
- The seller would transfer the funds to the contract and customer can withdraw the  amount and the timer would start after borrowing.
- Before the transfer of funds NFT marketplace would take ownership of the NFT
- If borrower pays on time, NFT is returned to the customer, lender can withdraw the amount
- If borrower fails to pay back in time, ownership of NFT is transfered to the lender

### Optimisation idea: If first m loans are paid start checkUpKeep from m.
